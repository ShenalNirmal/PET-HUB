These dogs are extremely smart, but that intelligence can sometimes manifest itself in destructive behavior if the dog is left alone or not properly trained. A couple of walks every day, totaling around 45 minutes, should do the trick to keep the dog happy and healthy. Although, due to the mixed breed's intelligence, it's of great benefit to incorporate obedience tasks into the exercise mix to keep the dog alert. Children and Bordoodles are a great mix.

They're not a good choice for allergy sufferers. Hovawartsÿhave a medium to high energy level and, regardless of what type of physical activity your pup engages in, they will require at least one hour long walk per day. They're not recommended for first time dog parents as they will need someone who is firm, consistent, and will act as the pack leader. Hovawarts have a very dominant temperament, which oftentimes makes it quite difficult for them to interact with other dogs. It can be a tough task socializing your Hovawart with other dogs. However, as long as they are socialized at a young age, Hovawarts generally get along with cats or other pets in the household. The Hovawart is a great family dog and will get along well with children when properly socialized with them at a young age. They can become very protective of kids. The Hovawart has a coat that comes in three colors. They can be solid blonde, solid black, or black with tan or gold markings. Hovawarts will thrive best in a home with a large, fencedin yard. They are not suited for apartment life and can become destructive due to pent up energy from being in a small space."

Pitskies usually have short coats, and they're generally considered to be a good choice for allergy sufferers, as their coats tend to shed less than average. There are longercoated Pitskies, too, though they may not be as allergy friendly. Most Pitskies are very loyal to their families and kid friendly. Some may have a natural tendency to be apprehensive or rough with other pets, but early training and socialization can help overcome these tendencies. The Pitsky tends to require a lot of exercise. Most need two hours of activity per day. They make great workout partners and running buddies. No two Pitskies are the same, and they can vary quite a bit in size. It may be difficult to tell how big a puppy will be when they're fully grown."

The Thai Ridgeback's coat comes in a variety of colors, namely black, blue, red, and light fawn. Some may have brindle or white coats. The Thai Ridgeback can be a great, active companion for older children, as long as they know how to properly interact with a dog. The Thai Ridgeback tends to get along with other dogs. Cats and other small critters, however, may be subject to the breed's strong prey drive. The Thai Ridgeback is from a warm, tropical climate, which means that their coats aren't made to endure serious cold. Bundle them up during the colder months when they go outside. The Thai Ridgeback can fare well in apartments and smaller abodes, so long as they're given regular exercise and walks. However, do not leave your dog alone for too long, because they might engage in bored, destructive behaviors."
